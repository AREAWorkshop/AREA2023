                  <b>Abstract:</b> In this presentation, I will argue that the synergy between three factors is critical for creating reliable mission planning algorithms for autonomous robots operating in uncontrolled environments. These factors are <span id="dots2">...</span> <span id="more2" style="display:none">(i) utilising historical data gathered online to enhance decision-making under uncertainty models, (ii) implementing principled planning techniques that explicitly reason about the epistemic uncertainty inherent to these data-driven models, and (iii) incorporating rich specifications that go beyond typical expected reward maximisation problems. Developing frameworks that unify these three factors is an open problem in the field of robotics, which is heavily dependent on the specific application domain. I will offer an overview of various works undertaken at the GOALS lab at the Oxford Robotics Institute that consider these three factors in distinct ways. Moreover, I will describe how these works provide a foundation for creating integrated approaches that enable long-term deployment of robots capable of acquiring parametrised environmental models from historical data, plan considering the epistemic uncertainty of such models, and effectively adapt their behaviour to in-mission observations, continuously refining their estimate over the epistemic uncertainty online.<br/>
                  <b>Short Bio:</b> Bruno Lacerda is a Senior Researcher at the Oxford Robotics Institute, University of Oxford, UK. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computing Engineering from the Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal, in 2013. Between 2013 and 2017, he was a Research Fellow at the School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, UK. His research focuses on the intersection of decision-making under uncertainty, formal methods, and mobile robotics. In particular, he is interested in using a combination of techniques from learning, planning and model checking to synthesise intelligent, robust and verifiable behaviour, for both single and multi-robot systems.

## Aim

<p align="justify">
Autonomous agents is a well-established area that has been researched for decades, both from a design and implementation viewpoint. Nonetheless, the application of agents in real-world scenarios has largely been adopted in applications which are primarily software based, and remains limited in applications which involve physical interaction. In parallel, robots are no longer used only in tightly constrained industrial applications but are instead being applied in an increasing number of domains, ranging from robotic assistants to search and rescue, where the working environment is both dynamic and underspecified, and may involve interactions between multiple robots and humans.<br>
<br>
  This presents significant challenges to traditional software engineering methodologies. Increased autonomy is an important route to enabling robotic applications to function in these environments, and autonomous agents and multi-agent systems are a promising approach to their engineering. As autonomy and interaction increases, the engineering of reliable behaviour becomes more challenging (both in robotic applications and in more traditional autonomous agent settings), and so there is a need for research into new approaches to verification and validation that can be integrated in the engineering lifecycle of these systems.<br>
<br>
  This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the autonomous agents and the robotics communities, since combining knowledge from these two research areas may lead to innovative approaches that solve complex problems related to the verification and validation of autonomous robotic systems. Therefore, we encourage submissions that combine agents, robots, software engineering, and verification, but we also welcome papers focused on one of these areas, as long as their applicability to the other areas is explicit.
