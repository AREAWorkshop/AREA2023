                  <b>Title:</b> <i>Synthesis of Fail-Safe Behaviours</i> <br/>
                  <b>Abstract:</b> Reactive synthesis techniques have been proposed  as a way to automate the production of software for autonomous cyber-physical systems. Such techniques have the advantage that the resulting software is guaranteed to realise a given target behaviour if the behaviour and models of the resources provided as input are themselves correct. <span id="dots1">...</span> <span id="more1" style="display:none">However, if the target specifies an unsafe behaviour, or the resource operations are unsafe, incorrectly programmed or the resource models fail to anticipate some failure modes, then synthesis may result in a “correct", but unsafe controller. In this talk, I present an approach to the synthesis of fail-safe controllers that orchestrate the activities of a set of resources to realise a target behaviour, and in addition guarantee the resulting behaviour conforms to a fail-safe specification defining what should happen if an abnormal event occurs.<br/>
                  <b>Short Bio:</b> Prof. Brian Logan is a Professor of Computing Science at the University of Aberdeen and visiting Associate Professor at Utrecht University. He also has an honorary position (Special Professor), at the University of Nottingham. His research interests span the specification, design and implementation of autonomous intelligent systems. A key theme of his work is 'safe AI', specifically ensuring that autonomous intelligent systems function safely and in accordance with their design objectives. The current focus of his research is ensuring the safe behaviour of autonomous systems that adapt or learn at run time.
He has also worked on a wide range of artificial intelligence research problems, including belief revision, reasoning, search and in agent-based simulation.

                  <b>Title:</b> <i>RoboWorld: assumption language for robotic systems</i> <br/>
                  <b>Abstract:</b> Robots affect and are affected by the environment.  Operational requirements often restrict the conditions in which a robot can be used, and many of the expected and desirable properties of a robotic system depend on properties of its environment.  Defining a complete model of the environment is not possible, in general, but it is possible to capture assumptions about the environment. <span id="dots2">...</span> <span id="more2" style="display:none">We will present a controlled natural language called RoboWorld that can be used to define (a) the operational requirements of a robot, and (b) how the robot interacts with its environment. RoboWorld has a hybrid process-algebraic semantics.  RoboWorld is part of the RoboStar framework of domain-specific languages, and plays a central role in proof, simulation, and testing of robotic systems.<br/>
                  <b>Short Bio:</b> Prof. Ana Cavalcanti's focus of her career has always been research. Her first publication came as an undergraduate student in 1987, when she got a prize from the Brazilian Computer Society. In Brazil, she pursued an MSc by Research (typically taken full time over two to three years); it was necessary to obtain funding for a PhD. At that level, she was already interacting with the international community, via the publication of book chapters and workshop papers. After the PhD in Oxford, she got a permanent Lectureship in the top Brazilian research group in formal methods. In those five years, she established herself as an independent researcher. In that position, she had a significant number of research students under her supervision. She published well in top national and international venues. In the evaluation of the Brazilian Research Council, she had the best possible classification for her level of experience. At York, she seeks to validate theories using real-world problems. Her main scientific achievements have been on the design and justification of sound refinement-based program development and verification techniques. She has covered theoretical and practical integration with industry-strength technology: concurrency, object-orientation, and testing, for instance.

## Aim

<p align="justify">
Autonomous agents is a well-established area that has been researched for decades, both from a design and implementation viewpoint. Nonetheless, the application of agents in real-world scenarios has largely been adopted in applications which are primarily software based, and remains limited in applications which involve physical interaction. In parallel, robots are no longer used only in tightly constrained industrial applications but are instead being applied in an increasing number of domains, ranging from robotic assistants to search and rescue, where the working environment is both dynamic and underspecified, and may involve interactions between multiple robots and humans.<br>
<br>
  This presents significant challenges to traditional software engineering methodologies. Increased autonomy is an important route to enabling robotic applications to function in these environments, and autonomous agents and multi-agent systems are a promising approach to their engineering. As autonomy and interaction increases, the engineering of reliable behaviour becomes more challenging (both in robotic applications and in more traditional autonomous agent settings), and so there is a need for research into new approaches to verification and validation that can be integrated in the engineering lifecycle of these systems.<br>
<br>
  This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the autonomous agents and the robotics communities, since combining knowledge from these two research areas may lead to innovative approaches that solve complex problems related to the verification and validation of autonomous robotic systems. Therefore, we encourage submissions that combine agents, robots, software engineering, and verification, but we also welcome papers focused on one of these areas, as long as their applicability to the other areas is explicit.

## Workshop Format

<p align="justify">
This event is planned as a half-day workshop taking approximately 5 hours. Depending on the number of submissions, we may organise a discussion panel at the end. We also have two invited talks.
</p>

## Submission Instructions

<p align="justify">
Participants are invited to submit either:
<ul>
  <li><b>a full length research paper</b>
    &mdash;
    a technical paper describing technically sound, innovative ideas that can advance the engineering/reliability of agents and robots; an application/case study paper, with emphasis on robotic applications where agents techniques have been applied; a survey paper on one of the topics of interest.</li>
  <li><b>a short paper</b>
    &mdash;
    a position paper describing relevant questions and issues that participants feel should be addressed; a demo paper describing a demonstration of an agent/robotic application, system or tool; a new idea in the field which is not ready for publication as a regular paper.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Full-length research papers must not exceed twelve (12) pages single column, and short papers must not exceed six (6) pages single column, excluding references and appendices. All submissions must be in English and PDF format.
Each submission will receive at least three single-blind reviews. All papers should be original and not be submitted elsewhere. The review process is single-blind: submissions should not be blind, reviewers will be.
<br><br>
<b>The AREA workshop is going to be an in-person event (following IJCAI-ECAI 2022 guidelines).</b> At least one author of each accepted paper has to register to the Workshop (via IJCAI-ECAI 2022 website, fees will be made available soon). Authors that cannot come in person to the event will be allowed to present their contribution online as long as they have registered for the workshop (no discount fees will be available, IJCAI-ECAI 2022 is entirely physical, we are only aiming to give the option to people that want to participate but will not be able to attend in person).
<br><br>
The proceedings of the workshop will be published with EPTCS (<a href="http://www.eptcs.org/">http://www.eptcs.org/</a>). Formatting guidelines should follow EPTCS style: <a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">http://style.eptcs.org/</a>
